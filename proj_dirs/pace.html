<p><img class="style19" style="float: right;" src="../images/tesser_pace.png" width="450" height="300" /> Temperature is significant for many applications such as weather forecasting, precision agriculture, and building management.
Indoor localization is crucial to enable context-aware applications, but existing solutions mostly require a user to carry a
device, so as to actively sense location-discriminating signals. However, many applications do not prefer user involvement
due to, e.g., the cumbersome of carrying a device. Therefore, solutions that track user locations passively can be desirable,
yet lack of active user involvement has made passive indoor localization very challenging even for a single person. To this end,
we propose Passive Acoustic loCalization of multiple walking pErsons (PACE) as a solution for small-scale indoor scenarios: it
passively locates users by pinpointing the positions of their footsteps. In particular, PACE leverages both structure-borne and
air-borne footstep impact sounds (FIS); it uses structure-borne FIS for range estimations exploiting their acoustic dispersion
nature, and it employs air-borne FIS for Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) estimations and person identifications. To combat the low-SNR
nature of FIS, PACE innovatively employs domain adversarial adaptation and spectral weighting to ranging/identification and
AoA estimations, respectively. We implement a PACE prototype and extensively evaluate its performance in representative
environments. The results demonstrate a promising sub-meter localization accuracy with a median error of 30cm.<p><strong><span class="style1">Acknowledgement:</span> </strong></p>
