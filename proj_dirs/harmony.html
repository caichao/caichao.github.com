<p><img class="style19" style="float: right;" src="../images/hi3861.png" width="600" height="500" /> WiFi sensing that exploits the invisible and pervasive wireless signals for ubiquitous sensing, has revolutionized a myriad of applications over the last decades. The key enabling technology behind WiFi sensing is the ability to extract fine-grained physical layer Chanel State Information (CSI), which however, can only be accomplished on certain specific hardware platforms with prioritized device drive. Additionally, this ability would render a WiFi card only capable of reporting CSI signatures but suspend its primary communication function. Therefore, the promising WiFi sensing technologies have never touched consumer markets regardless of their alluring functionalities. The status quo has changed thanks to the release of a ultra low-cost System on Chip (SoC) solution, namely Hi3861V100, that allows direct access to CSI in the application layer. In this paper, we build up a WiFi sensing platform based on Hi3861V100 and investigate its ability in common WiFi sensing tasks. The evaluation results demonstrate salient performance in several tasks. For instance, in a device-free localization system,  70-percentile of localization errors are zero. We believe that this unleashing access to CSI at the application layer would open doors for end-users to experience the amazing feats achieved in WiFi sensing.</p>
