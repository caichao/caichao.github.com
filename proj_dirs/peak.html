    <p><img class="style19" style="float: right;" src="../images/peak_detector.png" width="600" height="300" /> Peak detection is useful in a wide range of applications. To achieve this task, conventional approaches (including dedicated ASIC-based designs) often demand analog readout chains and compulsory add-ons (e.g., additional ADC for peak sampling), rendering them neither compact nor flexible. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-only solution to fulfill this task without any external components. Specifically, we achieve peak detection with only an LVDS comparator and two GPIOs. Therefore, one can flexibly make a practical deployment by a simple routing process, a non-trivial task even for inexperienced engineers. Meanwhile, to further compact the design for peak sampling, we leverage an FPGA-based slope ADC within which, we propose a new resource-efficient and calibration-free TDC architecture. The underlying rational is to minimize the nonlinearity problem by squeezing all resources within a single LAB. We have implemented a prototype using Xilinx FPGA and extensively evaluated its performance in rather challenging scenarios. Results demonstrate a peak digitization error of only about 30mV in a full 1.8V range for impulses with as few as 10ns pulse width. Meanwhile, in a practical deployment that requires a wide range of peak sampling, the achieved energy resolution is only 1.3% worse than a dedicated high-speed oscilloscope.</p>
